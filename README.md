# Weather App Using Api 
This app requires for you to accept the use of location information. When doing that the app will get your coordinates and pick a place nearby. 

What the app displays taken from api: 
- Your location
- The temperature 
- Weather description

## Api
The api being used is from: https://openweathermap.org/current

## Declarations
When fetching api from its source the temperature is being displayed in kelvin. Therefore a function for converting kelvin to celcius is used. Further implementations will be to give the users the opportunity to change to which temperature unit that is desired.
